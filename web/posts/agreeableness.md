Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.

They are therefore considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others'.
Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature.
They believe people are basically honest, decent, and trustworthy.
Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others.

Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable people.
On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations that require tough or absolute objective decisions.
Disagreeable people can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.

### Trust

A person with high trust assumes that most people are fair, honest, and have good intentions. Persons low in trust see others as selfish, devious, and potentially dangerous.

### Morality

Low scorers believe that a certain amount of deception in social relationships is necessary. People find it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward high-scorers on this scale.
They generally find it more difficult to relate to the unstraightforward low-scorers on this scale.
It should be made clear that low scorers are not unprincipled or immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly reveal the whole truth.

Those who score low on this scale are more likely to intimidate others to get their way.

In some cases this attitude may derive from low self-confidence or self-esteem. Nonetheless, some people with high self-esteem find immodesty unseemly.

People who score high on this scale are tenderhearted and compassionate.
They feel the pain of others vicariously and are easily moved to pity.
